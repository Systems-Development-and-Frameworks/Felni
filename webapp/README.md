## How to build webapp for production

In order to use our webapp for production please run `npm install` first in case you haven't done it yet.
To build and run our application please run `npm run build-start`.
Also make sure to run our backend and the neo4j database (see backend README for more instructions).


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
